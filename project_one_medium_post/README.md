## Project One - Write a Data Science Blog Post

#### Project
In this project, an exploratory data analysis was performed using public datasets - namely, Seattle and Boston Airbnb data, which are available in Kaggle's website, in the following links:
- Seattle data: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data
- Boston data: https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/boston

The EDA aimed to answer business questions that were posed after taking a glimpse at the available data.

#### File Structure
    - boston
	| - calendar.csv
	| - listings.csv
	| - reviews.csv

	- seattle
	| - calendar.csv
	| - listings.csv
	| - reviews.csv

	- airbnb_boston_seattle_analysis.ipynb
	- README.md

#### Instructions:
- calendar.csv has calendar data, with available dates for listings
- listings.csv has the most useful data for the analysis, with several information about users, hosts, and listings themselves
- reviews.csv has historical data about reviews, that is, the date when each review was made by a user
- the EDA itself is in the airbnb_boston_seattle_analysis.ipynb
- a medium post was written based on this project. If you are interested, please check https://istoia9.medium.com/this-will-bring-you-insights-about-airbnbs-business-in-the-united-states-2288d932bbe2
